# Failed Transactions
When a transaction fails you will be returned a transaction with a status of `FAILURE`. You will also receive a `reason` object with an `error_code` and `error_text` that will give you more information about the failure.

The `error_text` will be a sentence explaining the Failure and is the better option to be displayed to the user without modification. 

The `error_code` a string that you can use if you would rather display your own error message. The error codes are listed below.
